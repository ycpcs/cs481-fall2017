# Expectations for Weekly Demos

Here are what we would like to see from you for the weekly (Monday) demos.


## Journal entries (individual)

Each team member should have an issue in the group's issue tracker.  Each week, each team member should add at least one comment to this issue to document his or her work for the week.  
Each weekly entry should contain a list of the following:

* Links to issues that were created/opened by you 
* Links to issues that were closed by you
* Links to each commit made by you

Please format your entry as a *bulleted list*.

You can create a link to a commit by pasting the first 8 (or so) hex digits of its hash code.

Your journal entries should be complete by midnight on Sunday (so we can use Monday morning to read your entries.)


## Demo (team)

In your team's weekly demo, you have about 5 minutes to convince us that your team made a reasonable amount of progress for the week.

Here are some of the ways you can demonstrate progress:

* **Working, tested, integrated code**: Show us new features that are *working* and *integrated into your main codebase*.  This is generally the most useful type of progress demo.
* **Prototype code**: A standalone proof-of-concept demo is fine, especially in the early stages of the project.  However, all such work needs to be integrated into the main codebase in a timely manner.
* **Equipment/apparatus**: If your project has external equipment or apparatus, then you can show us progress on its construction and setup.  However, time spent on equipment/apparatus should be the mininum necessary to support the needs of the software you are creating.

# Evaluation

For each weekly demo, your team will received one of the following evaluations:

* **Exceeds expectations**: We think your project is progressing very well, and that you are on track to have a very strong final product.
* **Meets expectations**: We think you are making adequate progress, and that you are on track for a solid (but perhaps not exceptional) final product.
* **Below expectations**: We are concerned that you are not making sufficient progress, and that your final product will not meet the minimum expectations.
